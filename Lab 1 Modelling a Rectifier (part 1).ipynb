    "* Rectifiers are used to convert a sinusoidal AC voltage into a smooth DC output. \n",
    "* In reality, the output voltage is not perfectly smooth, but has a distinctive ‘ripple’ pattern. \n",
    "* The rectifier circuit features a capacitor, which is charged during the first quarter cycle (until the AC voltage reaches a maximum) then discharges during the region of falling AC voltage to keep the output voltage constant. \n",
    "* The output voltage of the rectifier is not constant and can be modelled by a Fourier series. \n",
    "\n",
    "This lab will have you modelling the output of a rectifier which is operating on a near-zero impedance source (such as the domestic AC mains supply). \n",
    "\n",
    "Each exercise is designed to guide you through developing a large program, function by function.\n",

    "\n",
    "> *Part 2* enables you to apply the skills you have learned in this lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "The graphs below show the results you should achieve by the end of this lab. The functions you have built will have a sine wave, a Fourier series, and the approximated ripple voltage for a circuit."
